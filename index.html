                <p>Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO (World Health Organization) declared that the next global
                    threat
                    as being <strong>superbugs</strong>, which are a form of bacteria that become resistant to
                    antibiotics
                    often produced by
                    living organisms. </p>
                <p>The Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance, otherwise known as GRAM, is a leading authority in
                    the
                    world of antibiotic resistance research. They carried out a study in over 150 countries that
                    predicts
                    that by 2050, over 39 million
                    globally will have died as a result of the excessive use of antibiotics, including last resort
                    treatments for bacteria that will have adapted to them by then.</p>
                <p>This threat looms over the head of the scientific health community, and despite the warnings, people
                    don't seem to be worried. Media coverage on antibiotic resistance is minimal, and governments have
                    taken
                    little to no action to minimize the risk and spread of these bacteria. So what exactly is it weâ€™re
                    talking about? Why should we be worried? And more importantly, what are scientifically proven and
                    discussed methods by leading scholars and biologists that will prevent another global outbreak from
                    happening?
