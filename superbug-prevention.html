                <p>Since anitbiotic resistance builds up over time the more you use them, the easiest and most effective
                    way of preventing
                    having antibiotic resistant is simply to <strong>not use antibiotics when you're sick with a
                        virus</strong>. Thousands
                    of people with sore throats, congestion and other common colds and flus demand to their doctors to
                    be prescribed antibiotics
                    not knowing that what they are infected with is a virus, and antibiotics can only preferentially
                    target bacteria.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Around the 50% of antibiotics are prescribed for people with viral, unaware that these are
                        completely
                        ineffective</strong> against
                    these forms of bacteria and since we're virtually exposed to different types of bacteria everyday,
                    they'll enter our system
                    and recognize what type of antibiotic is killing them. Using them sparingly is the key.
                </p>
                <p>Another way is to stop supporting and or buying from companies that excessively use antibiotics in their
                    feed that builds their way up the food chain and back to us consumers. Essentially, when large indsutrial 
                    food companies use antibiotics in their feed to protect the mass amounts of animals they have to care of,
                    the antibiotics gradually build their way up the food chain back to when we buy meat, poultry and or any type of
                    meat and or food that was processed in a factory in an attempt to not only make food 'safer', but to make it taste
                    better in some cases.
