                <p>As more people use antibiotics to incorrectly treat various ilnesses, colds and the common flu, last
                    resort
                    anitbiotics have become less potent. There are three stages of antibiotics used to treat various
                    bacterial infections
                    such as Klebsiella (a gram negative species of bacteria) and others like Staphylococcus aureus (a
                    gram positive species of bacteria):
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First Line Antibiotics</strong> - Used to treat common bacteria, but are now only
                        effective against bacterial infections that haven't been around for so long.</li>
                    <li><strong>Second Line Antibiotics</strong> - Used to treat more severe cases that tend to send
                        people to hospitals; for bacteria that's adapted to some but not all antibiotics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Last Resort Antibiotics</strong> - Very few available in the world and the most scarce
                        since these can only treat bacteria that have been around long enough to evolve and adapt to the
                        previous two.
                        Used in the ICU or when a doctors believe a patient is close to death.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It's important to be aware that gram negative and gram positive bacteria are two different types that
                    can't be treated
                    by all antibiotics. Gram negative bacteria have a thin peptoglycodan cell wall that needs specific
                    targeting from
                    antibiotics, which tend to be more likely to be resistant. Gram positive tend to have a thicker cell
                    wall that can easily be
                    penetrated but are still at risk of becoming resistant.
